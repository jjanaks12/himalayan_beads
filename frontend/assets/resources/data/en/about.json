    "description": "Growing up in a spiritual environment, we developed a deep appreciation for the undeniable value of Rudraksha beads. Over time, the global recognition of these sacred beads has steadily increased. Our journey began with our grandfather, who started buying and selling Rudraksha in small quantities to provide for his family and ensure a good education for us, his children. We proudly continue his legacy.\n For the past 15 years, we have been running our business in Sankhuwasabha, the Rudraksha market hub of Nepal. The quality of Rudraksha from this region is renowned and proven to be top-notch. Initially, our focus was on exporting Rudraksha to China and India. \n However, with the growing global demand, we have now launched an e-commerce platform as Himalayan Beads Pvt. Ltd. This allows us to share authentic knowledge about the profound benefits of Rudraksha and make our pure, genuine, premium-quality beads accessible to anyone, anywhere in the world."
